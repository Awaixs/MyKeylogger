Keylogging and Keyloggers
Keyloggers, or keystroke loggers, are tools that record what a person types on a device. While there are legitimate and legal uses for keyloggers, many uses for keyloggers are malicious. In a keylogger attack, the keylogger software records every keystroke on the victim’s device and sends it to the attacker.

An infamous keylogger attack uses a type of malware called DarkHotel. Hackers target unsecured Wi-Fi at hotels and prompt users to download the software. Once downloaded, DarkHotel acts as a keylogger and reports keystrokes to the hackers. After a certain number of recorded keystrokes, DarkHotel deletes itself from the device. That way, it doesn’t remain on a device for too long and can avoid detection.

It’s important to protect yourself from keylogger attacks used by malicious users. Because keyloggers can record and quickly identify sensitive information, they are a significant threat to cybersecurity. To protect yourself, it’s important to know what keyloggers are, how to prevent an attack and how to remove a keylogger if you are attacked.

Your personal information is lucrative to cybercriminals, and cybercriminals use various strategies to try to gain access to your sensitive data. Spyware is one kind of cybersecurity risk where a malicious user attempts to gather information about a user to cause harm. Cybercriminals often use a keystroke logger as spyware to track a user’s actions without their knowledge.

Keyloggers are spread in different ways, but all have the same purpose. They all record information entered on a device and report the information to a recipient. Let’s take a look at a few examples showing how keyloggers can spread by being installed on devices:

Web page scripts. Hackers can insert malicious code on a web page. When you click an infected link or visit a malicious website, the keylogger automatically downloads on your device.
Phishing. Hackers can use phishing emails, which are fraudulent messages designed to look legitimate. When you click an infected link or open a malicious attachment, the keylogger downloads on your device.
Social engineering. Phishing is a type of social engineering, which is a strategy designed to trick victims into divulging confidential information. Cybercriminals might pretend to be a trusted contact to convince the recipient to open an attachment and download malware.
Unidentified software downloaded from the internet. Malicious users can embed keyloggers in software downloaded from the internet. Along with the software you want to download, you unknowingly download keylogging software.
Safe Keyloggers
Keyloggers have a reputation of criminality, but there are safe and legal uses for keyloggers. While laws vary depending on the state or country, keyloggers are generally considered legal if you own the device. For example, you can monitor office computers if you own the business. Similarly, you can monitor your own computer even if other people use it. However, you cannot monitor a family member’s computer without his or her knowledge.

Another use case for safe and legal keylogging is during ethical hacking. Ethical hacking is a strategy where a hacker attempts to legally break into computers or networks. Organizations might use this strategy to test their cybersecurity.
